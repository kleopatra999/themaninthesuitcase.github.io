Way back in 2011 I was bitten by the astrophotography bug and enjoyed taking star trail photography.  For those who aren't aware what that is here's a brief summary from wikipedia:

> A star trail is a type of photograph that utilizes long-exposure times to capture the apparent motion of stars in the night sky due to the rotation of the Earth. A star trail photograph shows individual stars as streaks across the image, with longer exposures resulting in longer streaks. Typical exposure times for a star trail range from 15 minutes to several hours, requiring a 'bulb' setting on the camera to open the shutter for a longer period than is normal.

At the time there was no free software for the mac so I wrote a plugin for the free image program [GIMP].  This got a reasonable amount of use by others but not long after a few more fully featured software became available, I *ahem found ahem* Adobe Photoshop (and now pay for it) and the plugin fell by the way side.
