Welcome. I'm Chris Pearson, a husband, father and nerd living in the UK.

By day I work as a software programmer in the finance industry using Microsoft .NET technologies. By night I am an Apple fan boy, LEGO enthusiast and mediocre sci-fi nerd.

### About this site

Over the years this site has been many things from a static holding page to a photography site back again.  This iteration sees it back as a personal site where any subject goes.

The page you are currently reading is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a ruby powered tool that turns [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) into magical web content for your consumption.
