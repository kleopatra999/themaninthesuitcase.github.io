Listening to a podcast today I noticed something.  Halfway through a sentence a guest stopped to point out that the product was made in the US. You can listen to the episode of The Pen Addict at the right point [here][tpa].

It occurred to me that this doesn't happen here.  You almost never hear some one say that some product they bought was UK made. In fact on the few occasions it is mentioned it's usually to point out how poorly made something is. See [The IT Crowd][itc].

I wonder if this attitude is as as result of the decline of British manufacturing or the cause of it.

I find it hard to be proud of my nationality, after all it's an accident of birth.  I had no control of the nationality to which I was born.  By the same logic I am not proud of my race, gender or sexuality.

However I do envy the American ability to be proud of what their country produces and that they can "Buy American".
