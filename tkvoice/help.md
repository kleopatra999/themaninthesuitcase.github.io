**TKVoice requires additional hardware to get the best from it.**

First we recommend you enable airplane mode.  Nothing breaks the magic like getting a phone call whilst you're trooping.  

To do this simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open control center and then tap the airplane button.  This will disable stop phone calls and disable the wireless features of the phone.

Once in the app just speak into the microphone and the app will work it's magic.

## Settings
 - **Gain** - Increase the input volume from the microphone. If everything sounds super quiet or you can't get the output to start try adding a bit more.
 - **Sensitivity** - How much sound do you have to make to start the output.  Start with this maxed out and reduce it a little if you keep starting when you don't mean to.
 - **Delay** - The time from when you stop talking to when the static burst will play.  You want this as short as you can but if you keep getting a burst mid sentence try increasing this a little.
 - **High/Low Pass** - These two sliders are important to get that sound just right.  They remove the high and low frequencies from your voice and only allow a small bit in the middle though.  The defaults here should be fine but if you want to tweak them, here's where you do it.

## Required hardware
At the very least you will require a hands free headset, as included with your device, but the only person able to hear the effects will be you.

For best results you will require:

 - A 4 pin to mic and headphone splitter cable
 - An external microphone, please not all microphones will work.
 - An external speaker, any speaker with a 3.5mm jack connection.  Bluetooth has not been tested at this time.

Be aware that not all microphones will work, there are ways around this but it's easier to use an appropriate microphone in the first place.

When choosing an adapter be careful to buy a 4 pin (aka TRRS) to microphone and headphone cable.  The much more common headphone splitter cable looks very similar and will often come up in the same search.  

Also ensure you get an iPhone compatible cable. Cables for android devices will use a different pin layout and will not work.

**_Headset Adapter_** seems to be the magic search term for these.

### Tested adapters

 - Sennheiser PCV 05 - ([US][pcv-us]) ([UK][pcv-uk])
 - The "cheap and nasty one" ([US][cheap-us]) ([UK][cheap-uk])

I have both but the PCV 05 is the one I use.
