# Hardware

To get the most from TKVoice you'll want to use an external microphone and speaker.

At the time of writing there is no support for Bluetooth but this is hoped to be added in future.

You will need three components: A microphone, a speaker and a splitter cable.

_Please note not all recommendations have been tested by myself and may be community reported.  These will be worded accordingly._

## Splitter Cable
The splitter cable breaks out the iPhone input into a separate microphone and headphone connector.  These are often called headset splitters and are used with in gaming circles.  There's also a very similar looking splitter which gives 2 headphone outputs.  They look similar, cost about the same and some have very similar descriptions.  They also won't work, take care when ordering.

### Recommended
Currently there following splitters are recommended:

 - **Sennheiser PCV 05** - This is the one I use and have had no issues with. Amazon: ([US][PCVUS]) ([UK][PCVUK])
 - **Startech.com 3.5mm 4 Pin to 2x 3 Pin 3.5mm Headset Splitter Adapter - M/F** - This is a common one with users and is reported as reliable.  It's also cheaper. Amazon: ([US][STUS]) ([UK][STUK])

## Microphone
The microphone takes your voice and sends it into the iPhone.  These should generally work but there have been a few that haven't worked, though these may just be down to bad hardware.

### Recommended
Currently the following microphones are recommended:

 - **Neweer Lavalier** - Cheap enough to bulk order! Amazon: ([US][NUS]) ([UK][NUK])
 - **Pyle-Pro PMEM1** - If you want a headset style rather than a lavalier this one is reported to work.  Amazon: ([US][PPUS]) ([UK][PPUK])

## Speaker
Speakers should just work. If it has a 3.5mm input or you can adapt it to one then you should be golden.  Just remember that you will need this to be loud enough to be heard in a possibly loud environment and small enough to hide inside the armour somewhere.

I don't have any firm recommendations but products by Aker and Pyle-Pro are popular.  This section will be updated as firmer preferences come along.
