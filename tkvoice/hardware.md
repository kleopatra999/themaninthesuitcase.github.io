# Hardware

To get the most from TKVoice you'll want to use an external microphone and speaker.

At the time of writing there is no support for Bluetooth but this is hoped to be added in future.

You will need three components: A microphone, a speaker and a splitter cable.

## Splitter Cable
The splitter cable breaks out the iPhone input into a seperate microphone and headphone connector.  These are often called headset splitters and are used with in gaming circles.  There's also a very similar looking splitter which gives 2 headphone outputs.  They look similar, cost about the same and some have very similar descriptions.  Take care when ordering.

### Recommended
Currently there following splitters are recommended:

 - **Sennheiser PCV 05** - This is the one I use and have had no issues with. Amazon: ([US][PCVUS]) ([UK][PCVUK])
 - **Startech.com 3.5mm 4 Pin to 2x 3 Pin 3.5mm Headset Splitter Adapter - M/F** - This is a common one with users and is reported as reliable.  It's also cheaper. Amazon: ([US][STUS]) ([UK][STUK])
