#Privacy Policy

<small>Published: 31st January 2016</small>

Your privacy is important to me and as such TKVoice collects no additional data above what the system collects.

The application requires the use of the microphone on your device but this is in no way recorded or transmitted beyond the minimum required to fulfil the needs of the application. Sounds comes in, the are effects applied, sound comes out.
